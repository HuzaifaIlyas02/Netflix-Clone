# Netflix Clone

This project is a simplified front end clone of Netflix. It was created with ReactJS and uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API to search for movies and display details. It's responsive and functions well on devices of various sizes.

## 📦 Technologies

- `ReactJS`
- `TMDB API`
- `Firebase (Hosting and Deployment)`
- `Axios (API Requests)`
- `React-Youtube (YouTube Video Integration)`
- `Movie-Trailer (YouTube Trailer Retrieval)`

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.
- **Interactive Movie Trailers**: Users can watch movie trailers by clicking on the movie card.

## 🔨 The Process

I began with the initialization of the project using Create React App. This set the stage for a seamless development experience with ReactJS. After setting up the project, I then proceeded to create a repository on GitHub to manage version control and track the development progress.

The next crucial step was to establish a connection with the TMDB API. Utilizing Axios, I integrated the API to fetch a vast array of movie data, which would form the backbone of the content displayed on the clone.

With the API connection in place, I focused on the development of the UI components. This involved creating an intuitive search bar for real-time search functionality, as well as designing movie cards that would display the movie information in an aesthetically pleasing manner.

To replicate a core feature of Netflix, I integrated React-Youtube and Movie-Trailer. This allowed users to view movie trailers directly within the app, providing an interactive and immersive experience by clicking on the movie cards.

To make the app better, I tested and adjusted it carefully to ensure that all the features worked well together. My aim was to create a smooth experience for users, from watching trailers.

The final step was to deploy the application using Firebase. This made the Netflix clone publicly accessible and marked the culmination of the development process. The deployment process was also a learning experience, teaching me the nuances of making a ReactJS application live.

During this process, I carefully documented each step and what I learned from it. This helped me remember and understand better. It's a practice that has really helped me improve as a developer.
